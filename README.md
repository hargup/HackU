Vi - Text
---------

 
Vi - Text brings to you the powerful and robust features of classic VIM editor at your fingertips. Edit text areas throughout the websites seamlessly without the hassle of switching between the Mouse and Keyboard repeatedly. 
Click the text area, enter into a special insert mode of VIM and there you go editing with tons of embedded features.

Why Vi-Text?
-------------
        1. The biggest advantage of it is the time it SAVES once you have a little to moderate hands on experience with
        real Vim Editor. Just bug your hands on the keyboard and get going. (PS. If you don't know what ViM is, 
        ask any ViM user about its love for 'hjkl' )
        2. It could be customized and extended. 
        3. Our Target USERBASE are those people who have to do lots of writing and editing online and are ready to 
        learn a new experience. It's worth while saving huge time investment compared to what spend in learning Vi - Text
        or ViM.
        
What makes our Vi - Text different? - 
--------------------------------------
Well, It is the only of its kind which can allow you to directly edit the text area through the popular websites like Yahoo! Answers, Facebook, Google docs, Forums without opening any external editor or dependencies and harnesses the power of VIM.
What more can be done? - Since, VIM works on a different API, it is not possible to match the exact features, however those which can be have been implemented.

Limitations as of now - 
-----------------------

        1. Doesn't map all of the features of real ViM as of now but will be implemented shortly.
        2. Has not been ported in form of a plugin or addon. It executes as an userscript through Greasemonkey.
        2. and some minor UI improvements that can be made.
